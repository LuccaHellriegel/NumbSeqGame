				<h3>How to Play</h3>
				<tr>
					<li>There are <b>sequences of numbers</b>, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5</li>
					<li>
						These sequences are produced by taking one or two first values and applying a <b>rule</b>, e.g. taking 1 as
						the first value and applying +1, repeating this four times leads to the sample sequence above
					</li>
					<li>
						In each challenge you are given a sample sequence and three buttons. Pressing the buttons produces new
						number sequences, that follow a different rule for each button. You have limited tries, that are used up by
						pressing the buttons.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your job is to find the button that uses the same rule (not the same numbers, but the same rule!) as the
						given sequence.
					</li>
					<li>
						After choosing a button, you press the corresponding Answer-button (e.g. "Answer: A" button) and recieve a
						Code Fragment, that you need to save.
					</li>

					How to Win
				</h3>

				<tr>
					<li>
						After collecting all three Code Fragments, you go to the Code Checker page and paste them in there and check
						if you have the correct codes. If yes, you send the codes to the organisation team, which will confirm that
						you solved the challanges and awards you your points.
					</li>
					<li>
						All the challanges have a random element. The correct code is always the same, but the given sequence, the
						button-rules, and which one the correct button is, is new each time you reload the page. So you may reload
						as much as you want if it is too hard, but the challange will be different!
