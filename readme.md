# Number Sequence Challenge Game

[Play here and crack MathGlobal Corporations defenses!](https://luccahellriegel.github.io/NumbSeqGame/mathglobal-start.html)

Find out all the matching sequences and corresponding codes and check your solution on the end page! \
This is meant for a digital scavenger hunt, where you can challenge your friends. \
I added enough layers of obfuscation (+ using global objects everywhere for easier dev) to make the 
solution not obvious without first reading the code
and running modified parts of it.

## Number Sequences

In rule-function.js there are rule-function creating functions, that are used with random inputs to create the
rules that then create the sequences.
